# Semantic Segmentation with Segformer (Hugging Face & ONNX)
This repository provides a complete pipeline for semantic segmentation using the Segformer model. It demonstrates how to:

1. Download and save a pretrained model from Hugging Face.
2. Convert the model into ONNX format for efficient deployment.
3. Perform inference on an image and visualize the segmentation results.
