# Semantic Segmentation with Segformer (Hugging Face & ONNX)
This repository provides a complete pipeline for semantic segmentation using the Segformer model. It demonstrates how to:

1. Download and save a pretrained model from Hugging Face.
2. Convert the model into ONNX format for efficient deployment.
3. Perform inference on an image and visualize the segmentation results.

## Features
- Uses Segformer for high-performance semantic segmentation.
- Converts PyTorch models to ONNX format for cross-platform compatibility.
- Demonstrates how to run inference using ONNX Runtime.
- Outputs segmentation maps and overlays on original images.

## Python Packages
Ensure you have the following packages installed: 
- `transformers`
- `torch`
- `onnxruntime`
- `Pillow`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`

You can install these by installing the requirements.txt, `pip install requirements.txt`.
